Here is where I give you a list of what these programs do.

wellthisisbothersome.py is a program capable of running many different functions. You enter your IP, and then a second IP of a freind. Not all
the functions in wellthisisbothersome.py need a second IP, so in some cases you can just enter ''. If you want the first IP to be your own,
you can enter '', and it will default to the IP you are using. Here is a list of what wellthisisbothersome.py can do:

1) 'web' is a function that surrounds the user in glass. When certian peices of that glass are broken, the glass changes to cobwebs.

2) 'diamond' spawns a diamond block near the user. When broken, it spawns a bunch of cobwebs.

3) 'random' spawns a random block near the user. When broken, it spawns a bunch of cobwebs. This program may occasionally fail to start.

4) 'mirror' creates a mellon thing that copies your position, reflected across the x axis.

5) 'mind control' lets the person at the first IP control the person at the second IP.

6) 'drone' places a melon in the first IP world that copies the position of the second IP player, and vise versa. This means that the melons
represent the other player's position across worlds. The melons can move through blocks, but do not destroy them.

7) 'creeper' creates a giant evil creeper face that folows the player around.

8) 'tnt' spawns a nuke. Look out.

8) 'grid' makes lines of TNT across the axises. Great for creating underground tunnels. Typing '8' in as the program name runs 'tnt', and then
'grid'

9) dont do this one

10) 'spread' creates a slowly expanding brick block. It stops after expanding 15 times.

11) 'cannon' spawns a TNT cannon. It doesn't work very well.

12) 'follow' creates a bedrock snake that follows the player around. If it catches the player, it kills them.

13) 'follow2' is the same as 'follow', but with a slightly different AI. I personally like 'follow' better.

14) 'flood' will create a 30x50x30 block of water, submerging the landscape without damaging it.



This is a program.py is a program that spawns various brick structures. You will be asked for input immediatley upon running the program.
Enter one of the folowing modifiers:

0) '' will spawn no additional modifiers.

1) 'blob' will create a bunch of floaty brick blobs.

2) 'box' creates empty brick boxes.

3) 'glass' creates brick boxes that have glass walls.

4) 'pyramid' spawns a central pyramid.

5) 'web' spawns brick boxes bursting with cobwebs.

6) 'war' creates explosive brick blobs. Everywhere. Run.

7) 'jars' will spawn giant jars of liquid. Most are water jars, but some have lava!

8) 'ores' will spawn brick blobs, but some have ores in them! Gold and diamond are rarer than the others.

After you have input a modifier, a house will spawn at 0,0,0, complete with towers and a staircase to the stars. The staircase has supports,
and will punch holes through the terrian so as not to be obstructed.



banhammer.py allows you to enter the IP of a player, and they will rise into the skybox uncontrollably. lol.



iLoveTREES.py is a program that replaces some blocks with other blocks. You will need to enter a starting Y hight for the program to start
working at.

iLoveFLOWERS.py places flowers on grass blocks near spawn.You will need to enter a starting Y hight for the program to start working at.



sandfun.py is a game that sets up a pit with sand in the floor, and then drops the sand block by block. Try not to fall out of the world!



carp.py is a program where you can stand still and slowly delete your world. It's dumb.



I forget what yes.py does. Go figure it out.



pyramid.py creates a huge brick pyramid. It will take up most of your world. This program goes nicely with 'This is a program.py'.


Choices.py will place you in a room. The instructions will tell you which of two gold block to stand on. Disobaying these instructions does
not immediatley end the game, just takes you to different endings and events.
